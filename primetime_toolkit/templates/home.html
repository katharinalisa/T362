    <h2 class="section-title">What is the "Prime Time"?</h2>
    <p class="lead-p">
      Bec Wilson defines Prime Time as the period in life, typically between ages 47 and 65, when individuals experience significant transitions
      in career, family, health, and personal aspirations. During this stage, people often focus on planning for retirement,
      maintaining wellbeing, and exploring new interests, while navigating changes in work, supporting adult children, caring for
      ageing parents, and reassessing financial priorities. Embracing Prime Time means recognising the value of experience and using it
      to make informed decisions about the next phase of life, building resilience, strengthening relationships, and pursuing personal
      growth for a fulfilling journey into retirement and beyond (Wilson, 2025).

              Superannuation is a way of saving for retirement in Australia. It involves making regular contributions to a super fund,
              which is then invested to grow over time. The goal is to accumulate enough savings to provide an income in retirement.
              Superannuation is typically compulsory for employees, with employers required to contribute a percentage of an employee's salary
              to their super fund.

<!-- Section 1: What is Superannuation -->
<section class="slice" id="what-is-super">
  <div class="container-narrow">
    <h2 class="section-title">What is Superannuation?</h2>
    <p class="lead-p">
    Superannuation is a way of saving for retirement in Australia. It’s a long-term investment that helps you build a nest egg for your future. Contributions to your superannuation fund are generally made by your employer, and you can also make additional voluntary contributions. The money is then invested on your behalf, with the aim of growing your retirement savings over time
    </p>
    <p>
    Understanding how superannuation works is crucial for making the most of your retirement savings. Superannuation funds offer a range of investment options, allowing you to choose how your money is invested based on your risk tolerance and retirement goals. Over time, the power of compounding returns can significantly increase your super balance. It's also important to keep track of your super accounts, as having multiple accounts can lead to unnecessary fees. Consolidating your super into one account may help you save on costs and manage your retirement savings more effectively.

  <div class="content-wide">
    <h2 class="section-title">How Superannuation Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Employer Contributions:</strong> Most employers are required to pay a percentage of your earnings into your super fund. This is known as the Superannuation Guarantee.</li>
      <li><strong>Voluntary Contributions:</strong> You can add extra money to your super through salary sacrifice or after-tax contributions to boost your retirement savings.</li>
      <li><strong>Investment Growth:</strong> Your super fund invests your contributions in assets like shares, property, and cash. The returns help grow your balance over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessing Super:</strong> Generally, you can access your super when you reach retirement age or meet certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax Benefits:</strong> Superannuation offers tax advantages to encourage saving for retirement, making it a tax-effective way to build wealth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    It’s important to regularly review your superannuation, understand your fund’s fees and investment options, and consider seeking financial advice to make informed decisions about your retirement savings.
