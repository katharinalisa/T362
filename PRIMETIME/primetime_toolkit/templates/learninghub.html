  <h3 class="mt-4" style="color: #335C67;">What is Prime Time?</h3>
    <p>Prime Time refers to the period in life, typically between ages 47 and 65, when individuals experience significant transitions in career, family, health, and personal aspirations. During this stage, people often focus on planning for retirement, maintaining wellbeing, 
    and exploring new interests, while navigating changes in work, supporting adult children, caring for ageing parents, and reassessing financial priorities. Embracing Prime Time means recognising the value of experience and using it to make informed decisions about the next phase of life, building resilience, strengthening relationships, and pursuing personal growth for a fulfilling journey into retirement and beyond (Wilson, 2025).</p>

      <td><strong>How does Superannuation work?</strong></td>
      <td>
        Superannuation is a way of saving for retirement in Australia. It involves making regular contributions to a super fund, which is then invested to grow over time. The goal is to accumulate enough savings to provide an income in retirement. Superannuation is typically compulsory for employees, with employers required to contribute a percentage of an employee's salary to their super fund.
