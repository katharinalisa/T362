  <h3 class="mt-4" style="color: #335C67;">What is the Prime Time Toolkit?</h3>
    <p>Prime Time refers to the period in life, typically between ages 47 and 65, when individuals experience significant transitions in career, family, health, and personal aspirations. During this stage, people often focus on planning for retirement, maintaining wellbeing, 
    and exploring new interests, while navigating changes in work, supporting adult children, caring for ageing parents, and reassessing financial priorities. Embracing Prime Time means recognising the value of experience and using it to make informed decisions about the next phase of life, building resilience, strengthening relationships, and pursuing personal growth for a fulfilling journey into retirement and beyond (Wilson, 2025).</p>
