# Technical documentation of the Prime Time Toolkit

Overview: 
The Prime Time Toolkit webpage provides users with tools and resources to assess and 
improve their financial literacy. It includes 13 interactive web-based calculators, a 
downloadable spreadsheet, a self-assessment component, and educational content inside a 
learning hub. 

Core Components: 
Upon entering the webpage, a user has the option to either complete the interactive 
web-based calculators which consists of a series of calculations equivalent to calculations 
within the Excel spreadsheet, or a user can download the Excel spreadsheet and conveniently 
fill it out offline. Both options offer a save state which saves the data as they continue and can 
always be revised later on. In this way, progress will never be lost and users can safely exit the 
webpage and re-enter it to continue where they have left off. However, users can only save 
their progress when logging in and providing their email address as this is required to store 
details inside a database). 

Moreover, the webpage offers a (optional) Self-Assessment component which helps users find 
out about their current financial situation and provides personalised feedback and instructions. 
The webpage contains a Subscription email function which users can use to sign up to Bec’s 
Newsletters (this is only for demonstration purposes, and this function does not need to be 
deployed).   

Besides the already mentioned components, the webpage offers a Learning Hub which 
includes general and relevant information of the Prime Time and explains different terms used 
throughout the webpage. The Learning Hub also presents several articles of Bec Wilson for 
reference, linking to her official PrimeTime website.
